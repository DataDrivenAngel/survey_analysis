# Survey Analysis
Survey Analysis of a little fun survey from The Group Chat (TM)

The questions for this survey were crowdsourced from the surveyed population and may contain content that is not endorsed by me, any groups I'm affiliated with, or really anyone. 

The data was collected with a google form and was analyzed in Python with JypyterLab  using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
